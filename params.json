{"name":"Mince","tagline":"Lightweight database ORM for Ruby - Supports multiple databases","body":"# What is Mince\r\n\r\nMince is a ruby gem to provide a light weight ORM to persist data to a variety of databases in ruby apps.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this is so your application is not tightly tied to a specific database. As your application grows you may need to upgrade to a different database or pull specific models to a different persistence strategy.\r\n\r\nOther ORMs are married to the [Active Record Architecture Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern).  Although Mince can be used with the Active Record pattern as well, it is designed to be used in more of a [Multitier Architecture Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture), where the data layer is separated from the business logic layer in the application.  \r\n\r\n*View the [Why Multitier Architecture?](https://github.com/coffeencoke/mince/wiki/Why-multitier-architecture%3F) page for more discussion*\r\n\r\n## Language Dependency\r\n\r\n**Currently only compatible with Ruby 1.9+.  Support for Ruby 1.8 to come later.**\r\n\r\n# How to use it\r\n\r\nThis library contains the core components to use Mince [supported database interfaces](https://github.com/coffeencoke/mince/wiki/Existing-interfaces). These interfaces can be interchanged, but in this setup example we will be using [HashyDb](https://github.com/coffeencoke/hashy_db), which is an in-memory ruby hash database.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nInstall `mince` and `hashy_db` gems:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngem install mince hashy_db\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Config\r\n\r\nUse the config class to configure which mince database interface you\r\ndesire to use:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'mince'\r\nrequire 'hashy_db'\r\n\r\nMince::Config.interface = Mince::HashyDb::Interface\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use it\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Get the interface\r\ninterface = Mince::Config.interface\r\n\r\n# Add a book\r\ninterface.add 'books', title: 'The World In Photographs', publisher: 'National Geographic'\r\n\r\n# Get all books\r\ninterface.find_all 'books'\r\n\r\n# Replace a book where the record's id is 1\r\n# Use the interface's primary_key field because\r\n# some databases use non `id` fields for the primary key\r\nprimary_key = interface.primary_key\r\ninterface.replace 'books', primary_key => 1, title: 'A World In Photographs', publisher: 'National Geographic'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Deeper Look\r\n\r\nThe following pages provide a deeper look into Mince\r\n\r\nLink | Description\r\n----|-----\r\n[API Docs](http://rdoc.info/github/coffeencoke/mince/master/frames) | API docs for Mince\r\n[Existing Interfaces](https://github.com/coffeencoke/mince/wiki/Existing-interfaces) | List of supported database interfaces that can be used with Mince\r\n[Usage with Rails](https://github.com/coffeencoke/mince/wiki/Usage-with-rails) | More information on how to use Mince with Rails\r\n[Fancy Mixins](https://github.com/coffeencoke/mince/wiki/Fancy-mixins) | We've written a few mixins that provide some standard behavior to your models while using Mince\r\n[Development](https://github.com/coffeencoke/mince/wiki/Development) | Help by contributing\r\n[Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mince_dev)\r\n[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/#!/coffeencoke/mince) | Check out the build status of Mince\r\n[Why Multitier Architecture?](https://github.com/coffeencoke/mince/wiki/Why-multitier-architecture%3F) | Discussion about why to use multi tier architecture as apposed to others, such as Active Record\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\n\r\nYou can contribute to Mince by doing a number of things.
